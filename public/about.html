<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm Kris Cole, a web3 enthusiast who's currently on a journey to transition from a passive user of web3 to actively working as
  as a deveoper on projects that I find useful and interesting while contributing in my little way to the overall growth and 
  adoption of web3.</p>

<p>I bought a course on fullstack web development but procrastinated enough and didn't hop on it last year [when I had made the 
  purchase]. Having faced major identity crises, I now have a crystal clear career path and have started to put in the work to 
  to grow as a fullstack web3 developer.</p>

<p>While I work on my soft skills as a web3 developer, I'm also putting in the work to grow a profitable self-publishing business
  which gives me more liberty to further my career as a web developer. I hope to come back to this a year later and look at it in 
  a very different light. Baby steps!
